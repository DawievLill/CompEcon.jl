TODO: Maybe package in two modules, CompEcon, and CompEcon.(Original|Classic)

TODO: still need to write fund, minterp
TODO: also need splidop, lindop
TODO: funeval fails for scalar input and does weird thing for 1-element
      vector input
TODO: Decide if I should move core algorithms into julian api files or leave
      them in src/original. Right now src/original/core repeats a lot of code
      that is better written in src/

#=
Note that each subtype of `BT<:BasisFamily` (with associated `PT<:BasisParam`)
will define the following constructor methods:

```julia
# basis constructors
Basis(::BT, args...)
Basis(::PT)

# node constructor
nodes(::PT)
```
