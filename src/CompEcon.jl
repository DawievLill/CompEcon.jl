TODO: Maybe package in two modules, CompEcon, and CompEcon.(Original|Classic)

TODO: still need to write fund, minterp
TODO: also need splidop, lindop
TODO: funeval fails for scalar input and does weird thing for 1-element
      vector input
TODO: Decide if I should move core algorithms into julian api files or leave
      them in src/original. Right now src/original/core repeats a lot of code
      that is better written in src/

TODO: remove the x return value for evalbase
TODO: Simplify API by only allowing `order` in evalbase to be Int. Then we get
type stability in the first (soon to be only) return argument. We could
implement another method that expects `order=Vector`

TODO: rethink the `order::Matrix` thing. Maybe a convention we can adopt is
the following:

- If calling evalbase on a `*Params` type, we will say that order must be of
type `Integer` or `T<:Integer, Vector{T}`. The implementation for the `Vector`
case will just loop over each element and then call the `Integer` method,
which will have all the code
- If calling `evalbase` on a `Basis{1}` type, the semantics will be the same
as for the `*Params` case
- If calling `evalbase` on a `Basis{N>1}` type, then `order` can either be a
`T<:Integer Vector{T}` or `T<:Integer Matrix{T}`. If it is a vector, we call
the `Int` evalbase for the `*Params` along each dimension, then combine as
necessary. If it is a `Matrix` then we say that each column is the orders that
should be computed for each dimension and we farm it out that way.

So method signatures would be

```
evalbase(p::ChebParam, order::Int) => Matrix{Float64}
evalbase(p::SplineParam, order::Int) => SparseMatrixCSC{Float64}
evalbase(p::LinParam, order::Int) => SparseMatrixCSC{Float64}

evalbase(p::ChebParam, order::Vector{Int}) => Vector{Matrix{Float64}}
evalbase(p::SplineParam, order::Vector{Int}) => Vector{SparseMatrixCSC{Float64}}
evalbase(p::LinParam, order::Vector{Int}) => Vector{SparseMatrixCSC{Float64}}

evalbase(b::Basis{1}, order::Vector{Int}) => .... can't remember
evalbase(b::Basis{N}, order::Matrix{Int}) => Vector{... can't remembers}
```
